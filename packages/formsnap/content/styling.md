We apply data attributes to the various parts of your form so that you can easily style them using those attributes as selectors.

Here are a list of the attributes that are applied to the various parts of your form:

- `data-fs-error` - Applied to all the formsnap components within a field if the field has an error. Using this attribute, you can customize the appearance of the input, label, etc. when the field has a validation error.
- `data-fs-label` - Applied to the `<Form.Label />` component.
- `data-fs-input` - Applied to the `<Form.Input />` component.
- `data-fs-textarea` - Applied to the `<Form.Textarea />` component.
- `data-fs-select` - Applied to the `<Form.Select />` component.
- `data-fs-checkbox` - Applied to the `<Form.Checkbox />` component.
- `data-fs-radio` - Applied to the `<Form.Radio />` component.
- `data-fs-validation` - Applied to the `<Form.Validation />` component.
